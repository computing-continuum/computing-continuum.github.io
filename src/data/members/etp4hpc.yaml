  ETP4HPC is a private, industry-led and non-profit association. Our main mission is to promote European HPC research
  and innovation in order to maximise the economic and societal benefit of HPC for European science, industry and
  citizens. Our main task is to propose research priorities and programme contents in the area of HPC technology and
  usage, by issuing a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). This SRA is used by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) to define
  the contents of the HPC Technology Work Programmes.
